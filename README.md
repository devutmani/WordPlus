# WordPlus

Word Frequency Counter is a simple yet powerful application designed to analyze text documents or user inputs by counting the frequency of each unique word. The tool displays words and their corresponding frequencies in descending order, making it easy to identify the most common terms in any given text.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Input Support:** Read text from documents or direct user input.
- **Efficient Counting:** Uses a dictionary data structure for fast lookups and updates.
- **Sorted Output:** Displays word-frequency pairs in descending order of frequency.
- **Case Handling:** Optionally handles case sensitivity (e.g., treats "Word" and "word" as the same or different).
- **Punctuation Management:** Strips punctuation to ensure accurate word counts.
- **Graphical Visualization:** View word frequency data as bar charts or pie charts for easy analysis.
- **Interactive Visuals:** Explore word frequency visually with interactive plots (e.g., zoom, hover, filter).

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Text Reading:** The application reads the entire text from a file or input.
2. **Word Extraction:** The text is split into words, removing punctuation and normalizing case as needed.
3. **Frequency Counting:** Each word is stored in a dictionary, where words are keys and frequencies are values.
4. **Sorting:** The dictionary is sorted in descending order based on word frequency.
5. **Display:** The sorted list and graphical visualizations of word frequencies are displayed to the user.

## üìä Graphical Representation & Visualization

Word Frequency Counter supports graphical visualization to help users understand word distributions at a glance:

- **Bar Chart:** Shows the frequency of the top N words for quick comparison.
- **Pie Chart:** Visualizes the proportion of word usage in the text.
- **Interactive Plots:** (If applicable) Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to allow users to interact with the plots‚Äîhover to see details, zoom in/out, or filter words.

## üìù Example

Suppose you input the following text:
```
Hello world! Hello everyone. Welcome to the world of coding.
```
The output will be:
```
hello: 2
world: 2
everyone: 1
welcome: 1
to: 1
the: 1
of: 1
coding: 1
```
**Graphical Output:**  
A bar chart will show "hello" and "world" as the tallest bars, with other words as shorter bars.  
A pie chart will display each word as a slice, sized according to frequency.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devutmani/WordPlus.git
   cd WordPlus
   ```

2. Run the application according to the instructions in your preferred language (see below).

3. (Optional) To enable graphical visualization, ensure you have the required plotting libraries installed (e.g., `matplotlib`, `plotly`, or `seaborn` for Python).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

This project leverages the dictionary (hash map) data structure to store word-frequency pairs efficiently:
- **Dictionary Keys:** Unique words from the text.
- **Dictionary Values:** The number of times each word appears.

This approach ensures fast insertion and retrieval, even for large texts.
